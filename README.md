**Project Title:**  State of Obesity and Selected Social Determinants of Health in the United States

**Project Scope &amp; Objective:**

- Social determinants of health are considered structural predictors of overall health of the population. They include conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, etc. and socio-economic status, physical environment, access to healthy food options, social support network as well as healthcare. _ (__definition adopted from Kaiser Family Foundation)_
- There is growing interest within healthcare providers to combine wide variety of big data to gain insight, improve accuracy of predictive models and address increasing health risks of populations they serve. This project aims to contribute to their effort.
- Using publicly available data and an interactive website, we&#39;ll provide end users with ways to explore relationships between one health outcome and a list of social determinants
  - Health Outcome: Incidence of Obesity across the United States
  - Social Determinants:
    - Economic Stability: Level of Income and Poverty
    - Food: Locations of Fast Food Restaurants
    - Neighborhood &amp; Physical Environment: Locations of Fitness Centers

**Project Description:**

- Data Aggregation Plan:  Use multiple sources to create one database using APIs, JS, and SQL

- Data Organization: Access, clean and organize data using Python.
- Data Visualization: Create website and visualize data in a website map, pie chart and tables using Python, Flask, Leaflet, D3, Scrollama, HTML, CSS, Bootstap, and Heroku.

**Project Inspirations:**

- Ways to present health data:
  - [https://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/](https://stateofobesity.org/adult-obesity/)
  - Biodiversity project
- Ways to present a story:  [https://pudding.cool/2018/08/wiki-death/](https://pudding.cool/2018/08/wiki-death/)

**Proposed Project Elements:**

- Home / Index will provide scrolling text boxes that introduces the user to the site and &quot;our story&quot;
- Interactive map of the US, in where users can review data by zooming in or out
- On zoom in or out, chart(s) will adjust or filter to selected view
- Clicking on pie chart will filter map to show only points for that business
